# Lab 2 - Last Agent Routing Using Simulated Auto CSAT

## Story
> A common request for returning customers calling into a contact center is to work with the last person with which they had a good experience.  This may be because they are already familiar with what the customer needs or it may just be that the customer is familiar with the agent and enjoyed their last interaction. With the new Auto CSAT feature in the Webex Contact Center we can automatically account for this request and route to the last agent which had a high Auto CSAT with the customer.  
> !!! Note
      Because this is a lab environment and you will be playing both the role of the customer and agent, we are going to use a simulated CSAT as it would be difficult to properly score a call in these conditions.  


### High Level Explanation
1. New call comes into the flow
2. Call the Search API to find the last agent with which they had a good CSAT
3. If the agent is available, we will route the call to that agent
4. If the agent is not available or if no recent good CSAT scores exits for the caller, we will route the call to the queue for the next available agent. 


## Preconfigured elements
1. Wait treatment Subflow which will provide Music in Queue and Queue Messages. 
2. Connector for calling Webex Contact Center APIs
3. Agent Editable and Reportable Global Variable for our simulated CSAT

## Build
### Create an new flow

> Create a flow named <copy>CL<w class="POD">yourLabID</w>_LARwCSAT</copy>

### Create these flow variables

> Name: <copy>agentID</copy>
>
> Type: String
>
> Default Value: empty

---

> Name: <copy>queriedCSAT</copy>
>
> Type: Decimal
>
> Default Value: <copy>0.0</copy>

---

### Add the Global Variable simulatedCSAT to the flow
> There are no values to set because it has already been configured globally

---

### Add a Play Message node for our welcome message

> Connect the New Phone Contact to this Play Message node
>
> Enable Text-To-Speech
>
> Select the Connector: Cisco Cloud Text-to-Speech
>
> Click the Add Text-to-Speech Message button
>
> Delete the Selection for Audio File
>
> Text-to-Speech Message: <copy>Welcome to the Last Agent Routing with auto CSAT lab.</copy>
>
---


### Add an HTTP Request node for our query
> Connect the output node edge from the Play Message node to this node

### Add a Queue To Agent node
> Agent Variable: agentID
>
> Agent Lookup Type: ID
>

---

### Add a Queue Contact node
> Connect the True node edge from the Condition node to this node
> 
> Select Static Queue
>
> Queue: <w class="Queue">yourQueueID</w>
>
> Connect the Output node edge from this node to the Subflow node
---

### Add a Subflow node
> In the Activity Library pane on the left side of the screen, click Subflows
>
> Find the Subflow names WaitTreatment and drag it onto the flow canvas like you would any other node.
>
> Connect the output node edge from the Queue Contact node added in the previous step to this node.

> Subflow Label: Latest
>
> Enable automatic updates: True
>
> Subflow Input Variables: None
