# Adventure Awaits You!

## How it works
In this section of the lab you are going to choose your own adventure from the list of stories on this page.  After you complete a story, you will return to this page to pick another. Some stories may be more advanced than others.  If you want recommendations, feel free to ask.  Now go explore and play!

## Stories

### [Dial-A-Dad-Joke](dadJoke.md)
> Not every learning exercise needs to be overly serious.  This exercise is a fun way to explore the basics of and http request, JSON, text-to-speech, and basic flow logic, all while getting a little giggle.


### [Offering a Callback option to calls actively waiting in the queue](callback.md)
> If your wait times are longer than your caller wants to listen to your hold music for, you can offer to hold their place in the queue and call them back when it is their turn.  In this lab you will be adding the callback functionality to the CL<w class="POD"></w>_core</copy> flow.


### [Multiple Lines of Business Using the Same Flow](multiLOB.md)
> You do not always need to create a new flow for each line of business in the contact center, instead you can often reuse your flow logic and account for the differences including different queues and wait treatments.  In this lab you will be adding a new line of business to the CL<w class="POD"></w>_core</copy> flow.


### [Routing Returning Callers](returningCaller.md)
> When a customer calls back into the contact center within ten minutes of their last call ending, we can assume there was a dropped call, missed callback, or they need additional assistance from their last interaction. We are going to prioritize their call in the queue so that they can finish their business.


### [Last Agent Routing Based on (Simulated) Auto CSAT](LARbasedOnCSAT.md)
> A common request for returning customers calling into a contact center is to work with the last person with which they had a good experience. This may be because they are already familiar with what the customer needs or it may just be that the customer is familiar with the agent and enjoyed their last interaction. With the new Auto CSAT feature in the Webex Contact Center we can automatically account for this request and route to the last agent which had a high Auto CSAT with the customer. 

### [ Dynamically Controlling Emergency Flag in Webex Contact Center Using API](Emergency_Flag.md)
>In this lab, you will learn how to **dynamically record or update an Emergency prompt** in Webex Contact Center (WxCC). This is especially useful during emergency scenarios where a **Supervisor or Administrator** needs to record a new message or update an existing one in real-time — for instance, during a sudden outage or a weather-related closure.

The flow also includes an option to delete an audio file. **However, it is strongly recommended not to delete any prompts during this lab**. The delete option is provided for completeness and for those looking to reuse the same flow in a production environment.


### [  Dynamically Controlling Emergency Audio in Webex Contact Center Using API](Emergency_Audio.md)
